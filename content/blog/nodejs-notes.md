## NPM
- The difference between npm and npx is that npm is used to install packages globally and npx is used to run packages without installing them globally.
- The difference between devDependencies and dependencies is that devDependencies are only used for development locally and dependencies are used for production.
- The difference between npm install and npm ci is that npm install will install the latest version of the package and npm ci will install the exact version of the package.

## NodeJs
- The difference between require and import is that require is used to import CommonJS modules and import is used to import ES6 modules.

## Typescript
- The difference between tsc and ts-node is that tsc is used to compile Typescript to Javascript and ts-node is used to run Typescript files without compiling them to Javascript.
