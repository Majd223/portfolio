Developed Typescript static analysis Visual Studio Code extension as part of a team to perform static analysis to calculate the value of a variable without compiling the code. The project was done by parsing the Typescript Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for information about the code and performing logic calculations. Helped Team members by organizing GitHub workflow and explaining code implementation. Ran test cases using Typescript and jest.  Extension have over 300 users.
