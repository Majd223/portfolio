Working as part of a team to assess the strength of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) as unique keys. Simulating attacks using neural networks and machine learning. Refined attack methodology against simulated circuit boards using training dataset to increase difficulty and diversity of the attack. Testing supplemental features to improve circuit security through modifying the dataset of Challenge Response Pairs. Using Python, NumPy, CuPy, and wanDB to record, organize, and analyze datasets.
