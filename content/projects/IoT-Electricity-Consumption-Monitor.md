Developed an electricity solution for countries that canâ€™t produce enough electricity to be consumed. This project consists of small meters installed at every outlet to record consumption and collect it for analyses. The project is built with C# and using Azure IoT central, the code simulates two separate appliances and sends telemetry to IoT central so the data can be modeled.
