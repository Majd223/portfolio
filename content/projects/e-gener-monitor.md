Developed a mobile app in TypeScript to provide real-time and daily electricity generation data by region and electricity balancing authority. The app utilizes the EIA (Energy Information Administration) API to gather and organize data for user consumption planning, including the ability to optimize electric vehicle charging for times of peak solar generation. This project aims to reduce reliance on natural gas generators and promote environmentally friendly energy consumption.
